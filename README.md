# shade

A database where deleted data never truly dies—it becomes ghost data that lingers, influences queries, and can be resurrected. Built for developers who want persistence with a memory.

## The Concept

In most databases, DELETE means gone forever. In Shade, DELETE means transition to a ghost state:

**Living Data**: Active, queryable data

**Ghost Data**: Deleted but still present, decaying over time

**Exorcised Data**: Permanently removed after ghost decay

## Why Shade?

Sometimes data shouldn't disappear immediately. Sometimes you need a safety net. Sometimes the past should influence the present.

---

**Shade: Because data deserves an afterlife.**

> "In the kingdom of data, nothing ever truly dies—it just fades to ghost."
